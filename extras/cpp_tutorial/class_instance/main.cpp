// C++ is an object-oriented programming language. An object is created from a class. 
// Everything in C++ is associated with classes and objects, 
// along with its attributes(variables) and methods(functions)

// A class is a user-defined data type. It works as an object constructor
// or a blueprint for creating objects. 
// A class is static and it's a model which objects are built on. 
// Instance is the dynamic part and it's an instantiation of a class
